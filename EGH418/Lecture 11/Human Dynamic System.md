["Human Anatomy for Modelling"]

This lecture describes the components of the human body as a dynamic musculoskeletal system.

## 1. Human Bones

- **Quantity:** ~206 bones in the human body.
    
- **Properties:** Most rigid structure ($E \approx 20$ GPa). Come in many shapes (long, short, flat, irregular).
    
- **Roles:**
    
    - Give body structure.
        
    - Protect internal organs.
        
    - Provide anchor points for muscles.
        
    - Origin of joint motion.
        
- _(See Slide 3 in `MSK+modelling+lecture.pdf` for images of bone types)_
    

## 2. Human Joints

- **Quantity:** ~350 joints (articulations between two bones).
    
- **Properties:** Each joint has one or more Degrees of Freedom (DOF), usually rotational (e.g., hinge, plane, ball-and-socket).
    
- **Roles:**
    
    - Provide the DOFs for motion.
        
    - Limit the range of motion.
        
- _(See Slide 4 in `MSK+modelling+lecture.pdf` for images of joint types)_
    

## 3. Human Muscles (Musculo-Tendon Complex)

- **Quantity:** ~650 skeletal muscles.
    
- **Components:**
    
    - **Tendon:** Passive tissue, anchors muscle to bone.
        
    - **Muscle:** Active tissue, produces force by shortening fibres.
        
- **Roles:**
    
    - Contraction force is transferred to bone.
        
    - Acts as levers to produce motion around joints.
        
    - Ensures stability of the joint.
        
- _(See Slide 5 in `MSK+modelling+lecture.pdf` for muscle/tendon diagrams)_
    

## Purpose of Modelling

- We use MSK models to estimate **internal body forces** (muscle forces, joint contact forces).
    
- This information is the "holy grail" of biomechanics but is rarely accessible, as direct measurement is highly invasive (e.g., instrumented implants, tendon transducers).
    
- Therefore, we use dynamic laws to _estimate_ these forces.
    
- _(See Slide 9 in `MSK+modelling+lecture.pdf` for images of invasive measurement)_
