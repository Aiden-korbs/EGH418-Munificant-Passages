["Human Anatomy for Modelling"]
## 1. Human Bones

- **Count:** ~206 bones
    
- **Properties:** Most rigid structure ($E \approx 20$ GPa).
    
    - _See Slide 3 for image of different bone types (Flat, Irregular, Long, Short)._
        
- **Roles:**
    
    - Provide body structure
        
    - Protect internal organs
        
    - Provide anchor points for muscles
        
    - Origin of joint motion
        

## 2. Human Joints

- **Count:** ~350 joints (articulation of two bones)
    
- **Properties:** Each joint has one or more Degrees of Freedom (DOF), usually rotational.
    
    - _See Slide 4 for image of different joint types (Plane, Hinge, Condyloid, Ball-and-Socket)._
        
- **Roles:**
    
    - Provide motion between segments
        
    - Limit the range of motion
        

## 3. Human Muscles (Musculo-Tendon Complex)

- **Count:** ~650 skeletal muscles
    
- **Tendon:** Passive tissue that anchors muscle to bone.
    
- **Muscle:** Active tissue that produces force by shortening fibers.
    
    - _See Slide 5 for images of human musculature and the smallest muscle (Stapedius)._
        
- **Roles:**
    
    - Contraction force is transferred to bone.
        
    - Acts as levers to produce motion around joints.
        
    - Ensure joint stability.
        

## Purpose of the System

Used for daily living activities, sport performance, etc.

- _See Slide 6 for illustration of daily activities._ Defects (arthritis, fracture, strain) impact function.
    
- _See Slide 7 for images of joint arthritis, bone fracture, muscle strains._ Implants and surgeries aim to restore/optimise function.
    
- _See Slide 8 for images of joint arthroplasty, plate fixation, soft-tissue repair._
    

## The Goal of MSK Modelling

Internal body forces (bone-implant contact, muscle-tendon forces) are the "holy grail" of biomechanics but are very invasive to measure.

- _See Slide 9 for examples of invasive force measurement techniques (instrumented implants, tendon transducers) vs. computational estimation._ We use dynamic laws and computational models to _estimate_ internal body forces during motion.
