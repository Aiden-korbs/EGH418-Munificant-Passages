["Predictive Modelling", "Equation of Motion"]

**Forward Dynamics** is a _predictive_ simulation approach. It answers the question: "Given a set of neural commands or muscle excitations, what motion will result?" It simulates the cause-and-effect relationship from muscle activation to body movement.

## Workflow (Impulse to Motion)

1. **Neural Command (**$u(t)$**):** The initial signal originating from the brain/spinal cord (upper/lower motor neurons).
    
    - _See Slide 18 for diagram of motor neuron pathway._
        
2. **Contraction Dynamics:** Translates the neural command ($u(t)$) into muscle **Activation (**$a(t)$**)**, representing the state of the muscle fibers. Includes physiological delays.
    
    - `$a(t) = (e^{A \cdot u(t)} - 1) / (e^A - 1)$` (Example equation)
        
    - _See Slide 19 for diagram._
        
3. **Musculo-tendon Dynamics:** Activation ($a(t)$), current muscle fiber length ($l$), and velocity ($\dot{l}$) determine the **Muscle Force (**$f(t)$**)** using a [[EGH418 - MSK Modelling - 2. Assumptions|Hill-Type Muscle Model]]. Key parameters include max isometric force, max shortening velocity, optimal length, tendon slack length, pennation angle.
    
    - _See Slide 20 for diagram._
        
4. **Multi-body Dynamics:** The calculated muscle forces generate torques ($\tau_m$) around the joints. These torques, along with other forces, are used to solve the system's **Equation of Motion**, resulting in **Joint Motion (**$\ddot{q}(t)$**)** (joint acceleration).
    
    - _See Slide 21 for diagram._
        

## Equation of Motion

The fundamental equation governing the system's motion is:

$$\ddot{q} = M(q)^{-1} \{ \tau_{m}(a,l,\dot{l}) - C(q,\dot{q}) + G(q) + F \}$$

Where:

- `$\ddot{q}$` = Vector of joint accelerations (the output/result to be integrated for velocity & position)
    
- `$M(q)$` = System mass matrix (depends on joint positions $q$)
    
- `$\tau_{m}$` = Vector of net joint moments generated by muscles (depends on activation, length, velocity)
    
- `$C(q,\dot{q})$` = Vector of Coriolis and centripetal forces (depends on joint positions $q$ and velocities $\dot{q}$)
    
- `$G(q)$` = Vector of gravitational forces (depends on joint positions $q$)
    
- `$F$` = Vector of external forces (e.g., ground reaction forces)
    

## Use Cases and Challenges

- **Use:** Predictive "what-if" simulations, control strategy testing, animation, robotics. Can use machine learning to find optimal control strategies.
    
    - _See Slide 22 for examples of forward dynamic simulations._
        
- **Challenges:**
    
    - Very sensitive to model parameters (muscle properties, segment masses, etc.) and errors.
        
    - Computationally expensive to solve.
        
    - Determining the correct initial neural command ($u(t)$) input is very difficult.
