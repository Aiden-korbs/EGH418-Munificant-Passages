["OpenSim Software"]

OpenSim is a free, open-source, and extensible software application for musculoskeletal modelling and simulation.

_(See Slide 37 in `MSK+modelling+lecture.pdf` for OpenSim logo and GUI)_

## Key Features

- **Free & Open-Source:** Widely used in biomechanics research.
    
- **Functionality:** Implements the full [[Inverse Dynamics|Inverse Dynamics]] workflow (IK, ID, SO, JRA) as well as [[Forward Dynamics|Forward Dynamics]] simulations.
    
- **Community:** Model and data sharing is strongly encouraged via SimTK.org.
    
- **Extensible:** Can be controlled via GUI, or scripted with MATLAB and Python.
    

## Applications

- Gait analysis in patients (e.g., cerebral palsy)
    
- Sports biomechanics (e.g., golf swing)
    
- Surgical planning (e.g., joint replacement)
    
- Prosthetics and exoskeleton design
    
- Comparative anatomy (e.g., kangaroo, dog models)
