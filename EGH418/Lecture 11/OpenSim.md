["OpenSim Software"]

**OpenSim** is a widely used, free, and open-source software application for [[EGH418 - MSK Modelling - Main|Musculoskeletal Modelling]] and simulation.

## Key Features & Purpose

- **Free & Open-Source:** Accessible to researchers and students worldwide.
    
- **Platform:** Developed at Stanford University, with a large user community.
    
- **Functionality:** Provides tools to perform the entire [[EGH418 - MSK Modelling - 4. Inverse Dynamics|Inverse Dynamics]] workflow:
    
    1. Model Scaling
        
    2. Inverse Kinematics (IK)
        
    3. Inverse Dynamics (ID)
        
    4. Static Optimisation (SO)
        
    5. Joint Reaction Analysis (JRA)
        
    
    - Also supports [[EGH418 - MSK Modelling - 3. Forward Dynamics|Forward Dynamics]] simulations.
        
- **Extensibility:** Can be controlled via Graphical User Interface (GUI), scripting (MATLAB, Python), and C++ API.
    
- **Model Sharing:** Encourages sharing of models and data through platforms like SimTK.org.

## Applications

OpenSim is used in diverse fields:

- **Biomechanics Research:** Understanding normal and pathological movement (gait, sports).
    
- **Clinical Applications:** Surgical planning, rehabilitation assessment.
    
- **Ergonomics:** Analyzing workplace movements.
    
- **Robotics:** Designing prosthetics, exoskeletons, humanoid robots.
    
- **Comparative Biology:** Modelling animal locomotion (e.g., kangaroos, dogs).
