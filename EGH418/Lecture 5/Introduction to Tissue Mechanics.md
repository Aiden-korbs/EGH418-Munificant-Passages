## Rigid vs. Deformable Body Mechanics 
In biomechanics, we use two main lenses to view the human body:

- **Rigid Body Mechanics**: Assumes that body segments **do not deform** under load. This is a powerful simplification used in statics and dynamics to analyse external forces and overall body motion.
- **Deformable Body Mechanics**: This is the core of tissue mechanics. It acknowledges that biological tissues (bone, muscle, etc.) **do change shape** when forces are applied. This requires a deep understanding of the material properties that link forces to deformation.

## The Biomechanics Workflow: From Gait to Tissue Strain
We can connect high-level movement analysis with detailed tissue mechanics to see how activities impact our internal structures.

> The goal is to determine the internal stresses and strains in a bone during a specific activity, like climbing stairs.

The workflow typically involves three key steps:
1.  **Capture**: An individual's movement is recorded using [[Motion Capture Systems]] and [[Marker Models]] to get [[3D Kinematics]]. Simultaneously, ground reaction forces are measured with [[Force Measurement]] tools.
2.  **Calculate**: This data is fed into musculoskeletal [[Models for Gait]]. Using [[Inverse Dynamics in 3D]], the model calculates the forces at each joint and the forces generated by muscles.
3.  **Simulate**: These muscle and joint forces are applied as boundary conditions to a high-fidelity **finite-element model** of a specific bone. This final simulation reveals the detailed stress and strain patterns within the bone tissue itself.

## Challenges in Tissue Mechanics
Analysing biological tissues is complex because they are:
- **Multi-scale**: Properties are determined by structures from the nano-scale (amino acids) to the macro-scale (whole bones).
- **Multiphase**: Tissues are composites of different materials, like water and collagen.
- **Dynamic**: Tissues are living, hydrated, and exist at body temperature.
