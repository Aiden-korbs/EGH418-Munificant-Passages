## Why Use Beam Theory?
Beam theory provides a simplified yet powerful way to analyse the mechanics of long bones under load.

> **Applications in Biomechanics:**
> - Bone tissue stiffness analysis
> - Bone failure analysis
> - Design of fracture fixation devices
> - Studying bone adaptation to mechanical stress

While many [[Models for Gait]] simplify long bones as rigid beams or a [[Link Segment Model]], beam theory allows us to go a step further and analyze the deformation and internal stress within those segments.

## What Qualifies as a "Beam"?
In mechanics, we make simplifying assumptions based on an object's geometry.
- **Plates & Shells**: Structures where **one dimension** is much smaller than the other two (e.g., the flat bones of the skull).
- **Beams**: Structures where **two dimensions** are much smaller than the third (e.g., long bones like the femur or tibia).

> For beam theory to be accurate, the length-to-height ratio should be at least 10:1 ($L/h \ge 10$).

## Core Assumptions
Linear beam theory is built on two key principles:
1.  **Geometric Linearity**: We assume that strains are very small.
2.  **Linear Constitutive Relation**: The material is assumed to obey [[Constitutive Equations and Hooke's Law]].
