To understand a bone's mechanical properties, we perform controlled tests in a lab. The most common are bending and torsion tests.

## Bending and Torsion Tests
- **Three-Point Bending**: A single force is applied to the middle of a supported bone.
- **Four-Point Bending**: Two forces are applied, creating a region of pure bending between them.
- **Torsion**: The bone is twisted, which measures its resistance to shear forces.

## The Load-Displacement Curve
These tests generate a **load-displacement curve**, which tells us how the bone behaves under load.

> From this curve, we can extract key **whole-bone properties**:
> - **Stiffness ($N/mm$)**: The slope of the initial linear (elastic) region; a measure of resistance to deformation.
> - **Yield Load ($N$)**: The point where the bone begins to deform permanently (plastically).
> - **Maximum Load ($N$)**: The highest force the bone can withstand before it starts to fail. This is considered the bone's strength.
> - **Work-to-Fracture ($N \cdot mm$)**: The total energy the bone absorbs before breaking, calculated as the area under the entire curve. This indicates the bone's toughness.

By applying beam theory equations, these whole-bone properties can be used to calculate the intrinsic **tissue-level material properties**, like Elastic Modulus and Ultimate Stress.
