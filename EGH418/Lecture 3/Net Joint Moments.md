Net joint moment: the net rotational effect of all muscles, ligaments, and other structures crossing a joint.

In biomechanics, this is often calculated using [[Inverse Dynamics]] based on:

- Kinematic data (segment positions, velocities, accelerations)
- Kinetic data (forces, moments)
- Anthropometric data (segment masses, COM locations, inertia)

It represents the *net effect* — not individual muscle contributions.

Units: Newton-metres (N·m).

Moment equilibrium equation about the joint center:
$$
\sum M_{\text{joint}} = I_{\text{segment}}\,\alpha + \sum (F \times r)
$$
where:
- $I_{\text{segment}}$ = mass moment of inertia of the segment about COM
- $\alpha$ = angular acceleration
- $F$ = force applied to segment
- $r$ = perpendicular distance from COM or point of rotation

Net joint moment can be:
- Positive (extension or counter-clockwise by convention)
- Negative (flexion or clockwise by convention)
