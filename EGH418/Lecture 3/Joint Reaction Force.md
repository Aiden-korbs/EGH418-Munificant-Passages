Joint Reaction Force (JRF) = net force transmitted across a joint due to:
- Muscle forces
- Ligament forces
- Compressive or tensile loading
- External forces (e.g., ground reaction)

From Newton’s laws:
$$
\vec{JRF} = m \vec{a}_{\text{segment}} - \sum \vec{F}_{\text{external}} - m \vec{g}
$$

**Note:** JRF ≠ bone-on-bone force — JRF is the net force *excluding* muscle force contributions across the joint.
