Net muscle moment = the net torque produced by all muscles crossing a joint, without separating individual contributions.

Calculated from:
$$
M_{\text{muscle}} = M_{\text{joint}} - M_{\text{passive structures}}
$$
If passive structures are unknown, $M_{\text{muscle}} \approx M_{\text{joint}}$.

Used to infer:
- Whether muscles are contracting concentrically (positive work) or eccentrically (negative work)
- General activation patterns
