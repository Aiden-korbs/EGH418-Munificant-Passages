A modelling approach where the body is represented as rigid segments connected by joints.

## Assumptions:
- Segments behave as rigid bodies (no deformation)
- Segment length is constant
- Joints are hinge (1 DOF) or ball-and-socket (3 DOF)
- Mass concentrated at the segment's COM
- Mass moment of inertia about COM is constant
- Segmental mass distribution is similar for individuals of same population

## Free Body Diagram (FBD) of a segment:
- Reaction forces at proximal and distal joints
- Gravitational force $mg$ at COM
- External forces (e.g., ground reaction forces)
- Net muscle moment at the joint

**Link to [[Joint Movement]] in Kinematics:** both use segment COM location and inertia to analyse motion.
