A computational method to find unknown forces and moments from known motion and inertial properties.

Procedure:
1. Capture kinematic data (segment positions, velocities, accelerations).
2. Measure external forces (e.g., ground reaction).
3. Apply Newtonâ€“Euler equations segment-by-segment from distal to proximal.

For a segment:
$$
\sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a}
$$
$$
\sum \vec{M} = I \alpha
$$

**Link to [[Finite Difference]] in Kinematics:** velocity and acceleration often come from numerical differentiation of position data.
