# 3D Kinematics

Study of motion in three dimensions without considering forces.

- Describes segment/joint motion in all three anatomical planes: sagittal, frontal, and transverse.
- Requires tracking of translation (x, y, z) and rotation (about x, y, z).
- Common representations:
  - Euler angles
  - Helical axis of motion
  - Rotation matrices
- Applications in [[-Gait Analysis-]] and [[Inverse Dynamics in 3D]].
