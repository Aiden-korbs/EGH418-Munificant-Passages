- **Definition**: The fixed point in a plane about which a body rotates at a given instant.
- Found using perpendicular bisectors of displacement vectors of two points on the segment.
- Important for:
  - Determining joint motion characteristics.
  - Estimating functional joint centers in [[Models for Gait]].
