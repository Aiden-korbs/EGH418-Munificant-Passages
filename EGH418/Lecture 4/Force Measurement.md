- Measures external forces acting on the body during movement.
- Primary tools:
  - Force plates (ground reaction forces)
  - In-shoe pressure sensors
- Parameters:
  - Vertical, anterior–posterior, and medial–lateral force components.
- Used with [[Inverse Dynamics in 3D]] for joint load estimation.
