# Marker Models

- **Definition**: Arrangement of reflective or active markers placed on anatomical landmarks.
- Used for [[Motion Capture Systems]] to reconstruct 3D kinematics.
- Types:
  - Cluster marker sets (attached to rigid plates)
  - Anatomical marker sets (directly over landmarks)
- Important considerations:
  - Skin movement artefact
  - Visibility to all cameras
