# Inverse Dynamics in 3D

- **Purpose**: Determine net joint forces and moments from measured motion (kinematics) and external forces.
- Requires:
  - [[3D Kinematics]]
  - [[Force Measurement]]
  - Segment inertial properties (from [[-Anthropometry-]])
- Steps:
  1. Measure kinematics with [[Motion Capture Systems]].
  2. Measure ground reaction forces.
  3. Apply Newtonâ€“Euler equations in 3D to each segment.
