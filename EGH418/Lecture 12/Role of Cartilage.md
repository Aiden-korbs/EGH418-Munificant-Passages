["Cartilage Growth", "Endochondral Ossification Intro"]

This lecture explains _why_ cartilage is the key material for skeletal growth.

## The Growth Problem

- How can bones get longer while actively supporting loads?
    
- You can't just add bone to the ends; the forces would crush the bone-forming cells (osteoblasts).
    
- You can't expand from within; mineralized bone is too rigid.

## Cartilage is the Solution

- Cartilage is a soft tissue that _can_ expand from within (**interstitial growth**), as cells extrude new matrix.
    
- It is a load-bearing material, suitable for development, because it can support high **compressive (hydrostatic)** stresses.
    
- Bone is better suited for **shear (deviatoric)** stresses.

## Cartilage in Development

- Most of the skeleton is first formed as cartilage models, or **anlagen**.
    
- This cartilage is later replaced by bone in a process called [[Longitudinal Bone Growth|Endochondral Ossification]].
    
- Cartilage persists in postnatal life as:
    
    1. **Growth Plates (Physis):** For longitudinal bone growth.
        
    2. **Articular Surfaces:** For joint articulation.
