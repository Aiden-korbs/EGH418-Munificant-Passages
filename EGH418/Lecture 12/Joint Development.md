This lecture explains how the characteristic, interlocking shapes of synovial joints are formed.

## Formation & Shaping

- **Cavitation:** The joint space (interzone) is cleaved, but this doesn't always create the final concave/convex shape.
    
- **Mechanical Influence:** Forces, movements, and [[Historical Foundation|mechanobiology]] modify the geometry during later development.

## Fick's Experiment (1890)

- A simple mechanical model using gypsum blocks and rubber tubes (simulating muscles).
    
- Repeated rotation caused the blocks to wear into a concave/convex joint.
    
- **Key finding:** The concave surface always formed on the block where the "muscles" were attached _closest_ to the joint interface.

## Biological Mechanisms

- In real joints, tissues don't "wear away".
    
- Instead, mechanical stresses have two effects:
    
    1. **Direct physical sculpting** of soft tissues.
        
    2. **Mechanobiological influence:** Modulating chondrocyte mitosis and matrix synthesis.
        
- This creates spatial variations in growth rates, causing the chondroepiphyses to change shape and become kinematically efficient.

## Mechanobiological Growth Hypothesis

- **Cyclic Hydrostatic Compression** $\rightarrow$ **Inhibits** growth.
    
- **Cyclic Hydrostatic Tension** $\rightarrow$ **Accelerates** growth.
    
- **Cyclic Octahedral Shear Stress** $\rightarrow$ **Accelerates** growth.
    
- This explains how joint surfaces form:
    
    - A convex surface (like a femoral condyle) forms because the contact area sweeps over a broad region.
        
    - A concave surface (like a tibial plateau) forms because the contact area stays in the center, inhibiting growth and creating a "bowl".
        
- This is explored computationally in the [[Case Studies]].
