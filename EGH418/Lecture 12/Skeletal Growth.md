["Skeletal Growth and Adaptation", "Mechanobiology Intro"]

This lecture series explores how **function determines form** in the skeleton, focusing on the role of mechanical factors ([[Historical Foundation|Mechanobiology]]). Based on `skeletal-growth%26adaptation.pdf`.

> "It would... be an exaggeration to see in every bone nothing more than a resultant of immediate and direct physical or mechanical conditions... But I maintain that it is no less an exaggeration if we tend to neglect these direct physical and mechanical modes of causation altogether..." - D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, 1917 _(Slide 3)_
