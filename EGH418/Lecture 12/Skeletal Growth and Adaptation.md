This topic explores how "form follows function." It is the study of how mechanical forces and loading influence the development, growth, maintenance, and adaptation of the skeleton.

## Core Concepts

- **[[Mechanobiology]]**: The study of how mechanical loading regulates biological processes.
    
- **[[Wolff's Law]]**: (From revision PDF) Bone adapts to the loads it experiences. Trabecular structures align with principal stress trajectories.
    
- **[[The Mechanostat Model]]**: (From revision PDF) A theory by Harold Frost describing bone adaptation. Bone mass is adjusted to keep the "habitual strain" near a biological "set point."
    
    - Strains below the set point (disuse) -> Bone resorption.
        
    - Strains above the set point (overload) -> Bone formation.
        

## Role of Mechanical Loading in Utero

Muscular contractions _in utero_ are critical for normal skeletal development.

- **Clinical Example:** `[[Developmental Dislocation of the Hip (DDH)]]`
    
    - Abnormal loading on the hip joint leads to altered growth and ossification, causing a shallow acetabulum and a valgus hip.
        
- **Clinical Example:** `[[Fetal Hypokinesia]]`
    
    - Reduced fetal movement leads to abnormally thin, fragile bones (low bone mass and small diameters).
        

## Longitudinal Bone Growth (Growth in Length)

Longitudinal growth occurs at the **growth plate (physis)**, a region of cartilage separating the epiphysis and metaphysis.

### Zones of the Growth Plate

1. **Reserve (Resting) Zone:** Anchors the plate to the epiphysis. Contains chondroprogenitor cells that divide slowly.
    
2. **Proliferative Zone:** Chondrocytes divide rapidly and arrange into columns. This is the primary region where growth in length occurs.
    
3. **Hypertrophic Zone:** Chondrocytes stop dividing, mature, and hypertrophy (increase volume 4-10x). They secrete molecules that prepare the matrix for calcification and then undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death).
    

## Joint Development

Mechanical forces are essential for sculpting the final shape of joint surfaces (e.g., from flat rudiments to congruent convex-concave surfaces).

### Mechanobiological Growth Algorithm

This theory, supported by computational models (Heegaard, Giorgi), proposes that:

- **Hydrostatic Compressive Stress** -> _Inhibits_ cartilage growth.
    
- **Hydrostatic Tensile Stress** -> _Accelerates_ cartilage growth.
    
- **Octahedral Shear Stress** -> _Accelerates_ cartilage growth.
    

In a developing joint, high compression in the center of contact inhibits growth, while accelerated growth at the periphery (due to tension/shear) forms the concave "socket."
