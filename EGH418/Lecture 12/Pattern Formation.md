["Epigenesis", "Embryonic Skeletal Development"]

This lecture covers the initial formation of the skeleton during embryonic development.

## Epigenesis vs. Preformation

- **Preformation (17th C):** Belief that a miniature, fully formed person existed in the gamete. _(See Slide 18 in `skeletal-growth&adaptation.pdf` for Hartsoeker's drawing)_
    
- **Epigenesis (18th C - Present):** The correct theory. A fertilized ovum contains the _genetic information_ for the progressive development of characteristic features through cell division, differentiation, and organization.
    
- _(See Slides 19-20 in `skeletal-growth&adaptation.pdf`)_
    

## Embryonic Timeline

- **~32 days:** Mesenchymal condensations (first skeletal rudiments) appear.
    
- **~5-7 wks:** Most skeletal elements, muscles, and ligaments have formed. Involuntary muscle contractions begin, coinciding with the start of ossification.
    
- **~8 wks:** Full differentiation is nearly complete. _(See Slide 21 in `skeletal-growth&adaptation.pdf` for 11-week fetus ossification map)_
    
- **~60 days:** Fetal life begins.
    
- **~100 days:** All basic movements of a newborn are observable.
    

**Key Concept:** Mechanical loading from muscular contractions is critically important for regulating skeletogenesis (cartilage growth, ossification, bone modeling) _in utero_.
