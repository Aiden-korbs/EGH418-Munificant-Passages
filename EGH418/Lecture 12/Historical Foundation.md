["Teleology", "Neo-Darwinism", "EES", "History of Mechanobiology"]

This lecture traces the history of thought on how biological form and function are related.

## Teleology (Antiquity - 1800s)

- The view that natural processes move toward a predetermined end.
    
- **"Argument by Design"** (W. Paley): The function of a structure is the final argument for its existence (e.g., "Giraffes have long necks _so that_ they can eat leaves").
    
- This view was rejected by later theories.

## Darwinism & Natural Selection

- **Darwin (1872):** Introduced natural selection (survival of the fittest) acting on random, minor, heritable changes. Rejected teleology.
    
- Still accepted the **Lamarckian principle** (heritability of acquired traits, e.g., use/disuse).
    
- _(See Slides 10-12 in `skeletal-growth&adaptation.pdf`)_
    

## Neo-Darwinism (1880s - Mid-20th Century)

- **Weismann (1883):** Rejected Lamarckism. No mechanism for use/disuse to alter genes.
    
- **Watson & Crick (1953):** Discovery of the genetic code confirmed this.
    
- **Neo-Darwinism:** Evolution is based _only_ on random genetic mutation and natural selection.
    
- Acknowledged **Developmental Constraints**: Biological processes limit the possible forms that can evolve.

## Extended Evolutionary Synthesis (EES)

- A modern expansion of Neo-Darwinism.
    
- Includes non-genetic inheritance mechanisms:
    
    1. **Epigenetic Inheritance:** Environmental factors alter gene _expression_ (not sequence) in a heritable way.
        
    2. **Developmental Plasticity:** Organism's development responds adaptively to environment.
        
    3. **"Soft Inheritance":** Re-introduces the idea of acquired characteristics via epigenetic mechanisms.
        
- _(See Slides 15-16 in `skeletal-growth&adaptation.pdf`)_
    

## Mechanobiology

- The understanding that **mechanical stresses** (function) regulate biological processes (form).
    
- Recognized by Roux, Wolff, Pauwels, Frost, Carter, and others.
    
- This lecture series focuses on this principle.
