This lecture covers bone formation types and how bones grow in width.

## Types of Ossification

1. **Intramembranous Ossification:**
    
    - Bone forms _directly_ within a mesenchymal condensation.
        
    - Forms the flat bones of the skull and face.
        
    - _(See Slide 38 in `skeletal-growth&adaptation.pdf`)_
        
2. **Endochondral Ossification:**
    
    - Bone forms by _replacing_ a pre-existing cartilage template ([[Role of Cartilage|anlage]]).
        
    - Forms limb bones and most of the postcranial skeleton.

## Growth in Width (Appositional Growth)

- While [[Longitudinal Bone Growth|endochondral ossification]] lengthens the bone, **appositional growth** increases its diameter.
    
- This process involves adding new bone to the _outer surface_ of the shaft.
    
- This bone is deposited by the **perichondrium** (in early cartilage models) and later the **periosteum** (the membrane covering the bone).
    
- This process is highly regulated by mechanical forces, as seen in [[Functional Adaptation|fetal hypokinesia]] where reduced loading leads to abnormally thin diaphyses (shafts).
