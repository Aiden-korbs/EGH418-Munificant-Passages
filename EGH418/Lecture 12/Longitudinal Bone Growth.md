["Growth Plate", "Physis", "Chondrocyte Zones"]

This lecture describes the process of longitudinal bone growth (**endochondral ossification**) at the growth plate.

## The Growth Plate (Physis)

- A non-mineralized region of cartilage near the ends of a long bone.
    
- It separates the **epiphysis** (end) from the **metaphysis** (shaft).
    
- New cartilage is formed by chondrocytes _within_ the plate (interstitial growth).
    
- This new cartilage mineralizes on the metaphyseal side, becoming new bone.
    
- This process increases the bone's length while the growth plate thickness remains relatively constant.

## Zones of the Growth Plate

(From epiphyseal to metaphyseal side)

1. **Reserve or Resting Zone:**
    
    - Anchored to the epiphysis.
        
    - Cells divide slowly to supply the proliferative zone.
        
2. **Proliferative Zone:**
    
    - Chondrocytes divide rapidly and arrange in columns ("stacks of coins").
        
    - This is the region where **most of the growth in length occurs** (due to cell proliferation).
        
    - Collagen fibers align parallel to the cell columns.
        
3. **Hypertrophic Zone:**
    
    - Chondrocytes stop proliferating, mature, and **hypertrophy** (swell 4-10x).
        
    - They secrete matrix and molecules that prepare the cartilage for calcification.
        
    - They then undergo **apoptosis** (programmed cell death), allowing bone-forming cells to invade.
