This lecture explores how mechanical loading (function) regulates skeletal development (form), both _in utero_ and postnatally.

## Mechanobiology in Utero

- Intermittent stresses from muscle contractions modulate cartilage growth and ossification.
    
- This process is related to **Wolff's Law**: Bone adapts to mechanical loads.
    
- Altered loading _in utero_ $\rightarrow$ abnormal skeletal morphology.

## Clinical Examples of Altered Loading

1. **Developmental Dislocation of the Hip (DDH):**
    
    - Femoral head is separated from the acetabulum.
        
    - This alters mechanical forces, causing accelerated growth at the medial femoral neck.
        
    - Leads to a **valgus hip** and delayed ossification of the femoral head.
        
    - _(See Slides 24-25 in `skeletal-growth&adaptation.pdf` for DDH diagrams)_
        
2. **Fetal Hypokinesia (Reduced Movement):**
    
    - Caused by neuromuscular disorders.
        
    - Leads to abnormal joint development.
        
    - Long bone _length_ is not greatly affected, but **bone mass and midshaft diameters are much less than normal**.
        
    - This results in fragile bones that fracture easily.

## Postnatal Allometric Growth

- The skeleton at birth is largely cartilage.
    
- Growth over the next 16-18 years is **allometric** (non-isometric).
    
- Different regions grow at different rates, leading to dramatic changes in shape and proportion (e.g., newborn vs. adult skull/limb ratio).
    
- _(See Slides 27-28 in `skeletal-growth&adaptation.pdf` for newborn vs. adult skeleton comparison)_
