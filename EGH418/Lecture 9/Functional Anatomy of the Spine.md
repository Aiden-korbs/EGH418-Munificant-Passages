The human spine is a complex and remarkable mechanical structure, responsible for transferring loads from the head and trunk to the pelvis while also allowing motion and protecting the spinal cord.

## The Vertebral Column
The spine consists of 24 articulating vertebrae and 9 fused vertebrae at the base. It is characterised by four physiological curvatures that act as a central damper for the body.
- **Cervical Lordosis** (inward curve)
- **Thoracic Kyphosis** (outward curve)
- **Lumbar Lordosis** (inward curve)
- **Sacrum and Coccyx**

### The Functional Spinal Unit (FSU)
The smallest physiological unit of the spine that represents its biomechanical behaviour is the **Functional Spinal Unit (FSU)**.
> An FSU consists of two adjacent vertebrae, the intervertebral disc (IVD) between them, and all connecting soft tissues like ligaments and facet joint capsules.

## Components of the FSU

### Vertebrae
- **Vertebral Body**: The large, cylindrical anterior portion designed to withstand compressive loads. Vertebral bodies become progressively larger down the spine to support the increasing superimposed weight.
- **Vertebral Arch**: The posterior bony ring that encloses the spinal cord. It includes the pedicles, laminae, and various processes (spinous, transverse) that serve as attachment points for muscles and ligaments.

### Intervertebral Disc (IVD)
The IVD is the fibrocartilage joint between vertebral bodies. It is a viscoelastic structure that acts as a shock absorber.
- **Nucleus Pulposus**: A gelatinous, water-rich inner core. It acts hydrostatically, converting compressive loads into tensile "hoop" stress in the annulus.
- **Annulus Fibrosus**: Concentric, criss-crossing layers of collagen fibres that surround the nucleus. This structure is strong in tension and contains the pressurised nucleus.

### Facet Joints
These are the synovial joints formed by the articular processes of adjacent vertebrae. Their orientation varies by spinal region and is the primary factor guiding and constraining the type of movement allowed at each FSU.

### Spinal Ligaments
These are strong, passive bone-to-bone connectors that provide intrinsic stability and limit excessive motions. Key ligaments include the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments and the ligamentum flavum.
