Spinal motion is the sum of the small movements occurring at each [[Functional Anatomy of the Spine|Functional Spinal Unit (FSU)]]. Each FSU has six degrees of freedom (three rotations and three translations).

## Regional Range of Motion (ROM)
The allowable motion at each spinal level is largely determined by the orientation of the facet joints. This results in distinct motion capabilities for each region of the spine.

- **Flexion-Extension** (bending forward and backward):
  - **Largest** in the cervical and lumbar regions.
  - **Smallest** in the thoracic region, due to the stiffening effect of the ribcage.
- **Lateral Bending** (side to side):
  - **Largest** in the cervical region.
  - Moderate in the thoracic and lumbar regions.
- **Axial Rotation** (twisting):
  - **Largest** by far in the upper cervical spine (C1-C2).
  - Moderate in the thoracic region.
  - **Very limited** in the lumbar region, due to the sagittal orientation of the facet joints.

## Instantaneous Axis of Rotation (IAR)
For any planar motion, the vertebrae rotate about a theoretical point called the **Instantaneous Axis of Rotation (IAR)**.
- In a healthy disc, the IAR for flexion and extension is located within the posterior half of the intervertebral disc.
- With disc degeneration, the IAR can shift erratically and move outside the disc, often towards the facet joints, indicating joint instability.
