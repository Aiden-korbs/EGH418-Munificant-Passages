The complex structure and high loading of the spine make it susceptible to a range of injuries and degenerative conditions.

## Low Back Pain (LBP)
- **Prevalence**: One of the most common musculoskeletal issues, affecting up to 80% of the population at some point.
- **Causes**: Often idiopathic (of unknown origin), but frequently associated with a decrease in spinal stability due to trunk muscle fatigue, which leads to soft tissue micro-injuries.

## Intervertebral Disc Degeneration and Herniation
- **Degeneration**: An inevitable age-related process where the disc loses its water content (hydrophilic capacity). This reduces its elasticity and shock-absorbing ability, and changes the load distribution, putting more stress on the annulus fibrosus and facet joints.
- **Herniation**: A condition where the nucleus pulposus protrudes through a tear in the annulus fibrosus. This is not typically caused by pure compression but rather by a combination of bending and torsion. If the herniated material presses on a spinal nerve or the spinal cord, it can cause pain, numbness, and weakness.

## Stress Fractures
- **Spondylolysis**: A stress fracture or defect in the **pars interarticularis**, which is the weakest part of the vertebral arch. It is often associated with sports that involve repeated hyperextension of the lumbar spine, like gymnastics or cricket fast bowling.
- **Spondylolisthesis**: If spondylolysis occurs on both sides of the vertebra, the vertebral body can slip forward relative to the one below it.
