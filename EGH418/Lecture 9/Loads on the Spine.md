The spine is subjected to a combination of forces from body weight, muscle tension, ligaments, and any external loads.

## Compressive and Shear Forces
In an upright standing posture, the body's centre of gravity is anterior to the spinal column.
> This creates a constant **forward bending moment** that must be counteracted by the posterior ligaments and, more importantly, by constant low-level activity in the extensor muscles (e.g., erector spinae).

This combination of body weight and muscle tension results in large **compressive forces** on the vertebrae and intervertebral discs. Due to the lumbar lordosis, the body weight also creates an **anterior shear force**, which tends to make the upper vertebrae slide forward on the lower ones.

## The Role of Muscles and Posture
Because the spinal muscles have very small moment arms relative to the spinal joints, they must generate enormous forces to counteract moments created by the trunk and external loads.
> The major force acting on the spine is typically from **muscle activity**, not directly from body weight or external objects. Lifting an object with a flexed spine dramatically increases the moment arm of the load, requiring massive muscle forces and resulting in dangerously high compression on the lumbar discs.

### Flexion-Relaxation Phenomenon
During full, deep forward flexion, the tension in the lumbar extensor muscles abruptly disappears.
> At this point, the entire bending moment is borne passively by the posterior spinal ligaments. This "flexion-relaxation" places the ligaments at high risk of overload and injury.

### Intra-Abdominal Pressure (IAP)
Contracting the abdominal muscles increases the pressure inside the abdominal cavity. This pressure acts like a rigid cylinder in front of the spine, helping to stiffen the trunk and providing some resistance to the forward bending moment, thereby slightly unloading the spine during lifting.

### Asymmetric Loading
Lateral bending and axial rotation create much larger loads on the spine than simple flexion. This is because they require complex co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles, which significantly increases the overall compressive force on the discs and facets.
