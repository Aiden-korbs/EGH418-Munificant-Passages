Bone fracture healing is a complex regenerative process that involves a sequence of overlapping biological phases to restore the injured bone.

## The Four Phases of Fracture Healing
1.  **Inflammation Phase (Phase 1)**: Immediately after fracture, a haematoma (blood clot) forms, providing a structural scaffold and releasing signalling molecules (growth factors). This initiates an acute inflammatory response.
2.  **Soft Callus Formation (Phase 2)**: Over the next few days to weeks, the haematoma is replaced by granulation tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into fibroblasts and chondrocytes, forming a soft, fibrocartilaginous callus that provides initial stability to the fracture site.
3.  **Hard Callus Formation (Phase 3)**: The soft callus is gradually replaced by hard, woven bone through a process of endochondral ossification (similar to bone growth). This creates a bony bridge across the fracture gap, providing much greater stability.
4.  **Bone Remodelling (Phase 4)**: This final phase can last for months to years. The woven bone of the hard callus is slowly remodelled into stronger, more organised lamellar bone, and the bone gradually regains its original shape and strength, in accordance with [[Wolff's Law and Mechanostat Theory]].

## Mechanobiology of Fracture Healing
The mechanical environment at the fracture site plays a critical role in regulating the healing process.

> **Pauwels' Hypothesis**: The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into different tissue types (fibrous tissue, cartilage, or bone) is directed by the local mechanical stimuli, specifically hydrostatic pressure and strain.
> - High strain and pressure favours cartilage formation.
> - Low strain and moderate pressure favours bone formation (ossification).

This concept is the basis for modern computational models of fracture healing, which simulate how the changing stiffness of the callus alters the local mechanical environment, thereby guiding the progression of tissue differentiation until the bone is fully healed.
