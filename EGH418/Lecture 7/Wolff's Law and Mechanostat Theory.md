## Wolff's Law
First described by Julius Wolff in the 19th century, Wolff's Law is the foundational principle of bone adaptation.

> **Wolff's Law**: Every change in the form and function of a bone is followed by definite changes in its internal architecture and external conformation, in accordance with mathematical laws.

This law is based on three key principles:
1.  **Optimisation**: Bone seeks to optimise its strength while minimising its mass.
2.  **Trabecular Alignment**: The architecture of [[Trabecular Bone as a Cellular Solid]] aligns with the principal stress trajectories.
3.  **Regulation**: A biological regulatory system exists to sense mechanical loads and direct [[Bone Modelling and Remodelling|adaptive responses]].

## Frost's Mechanostat Theory
Harold Frost quantified Wolff's Law by proposing the **Mechanostat Theory**, which suggests that bone adaptation is driven by the local mechanical strain environment and is triggered by specific strain thresholds.

> The theory defines several zones of mechanical strain that elicit different biological responses. Strain is measured in microstrain ($\mu\epsilon$), where 1000 $\mu\epsilon$ = 0.1% change in length.

### The Mechanostat Zones
- **Disuse Zone (< ~200 $\mu\epsilon$)**: Strains in this range are too low to maintain bone mass. This signals for net bone resorption, leading to bone loss. This is seen in bedrest or spaceflight.
- **Physiological Zone (~200 - 2500 $\mu\epsilon$)**: This is the "lazy zone" or normal range of strains for daily activities. Bone is in a state of homeostasis, and remodelling is balanced.
- **Overload Zone (> ~2500 $\mu\epsilon$)**: Strains above the physiological range stimulate a net increase in bone formation, leading to a gain in bone mass and strength. This is the target for exercise.
- **Pathological Zone (> ~4000 $\mu\epsilon$)**: Extremely high strains can cause microdamage faster than it can be repaired, leading to stress fractures.
