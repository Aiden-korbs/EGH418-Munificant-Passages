Bone is a dynamic, living tissue that constantly adapts to its environment. This adaptation occurs through two primary processes: remodelling and modelling.

## Bone Remodelling
Bone remodelling is the continuous, coupled process of breaking down old bone and replacing it with new bone at the same location.

> **Purpose of Remodelling:**
> - To repair accumulated microdamage within the bone matrix.
> - To maintain mineral homeostasis (e.g., calcium balance) in the body.

This process is carried out by a team of cells called a **Basic Multicellular Unit (BMU)**. Osteocytes are thought to be the cells that coordinate this process.

### The Remodelling Cycle
The cycle occurs in a distinct sequence of phases:
1.  **Activation**: Precursor cells are recruited to the bone surface.
2.  **Resorption**: **Osteoclasts** (bone-resorbing cells) excavate a small cavity.
3.  **Reversal**: The site is prepared for new bone formation.
4.  **Formation**: **Osteoblasts** (bone-forming cells) fill the cavity with a new organic matrix (osteoid).
5.  **Mineralisation**: The new matrix is mineralised to become hard bone tissue.

## Bone Modelling (Adaptation)
Bone modelling is a different process where bone formation and resorption are **not coupled** and occur at different locations on the bone surface.

> Bone modelling is the process that changes a bone's size or shape in response to mechanical demands. It is most active during growth but also occurs in adults.

For example, increased loading might cause new bone to be added to the outer (periosteal) surface without a corresponding resorption event, leading to a net increase in bone diameter and strength. This is the primary mechanism behind [[Wolff's Law and Mechanostat Theory]].
