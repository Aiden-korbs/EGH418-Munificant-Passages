Experimental evidence has refined [[Wolff's Law and Mechanostat Theory]], leading to a more nuanced understanding of the mechanical stimulus that drives bone adaptation. This is often summarised by Turner's 3 rules.

## Rule 1: Dynamic, Not Static, Loading
The bone adaptation process is driven primarily by **dynamic loads** that cause changes in strain, not by static loads.
> A constant, sustained load does not provide a strong stimulus for bone formation. It is the change in load (strain rate) that is most effective. This is why high-impact, dynamic activities are more osteogenic (bone-building) than static holds.

## Rule 2: Short Loading Duration (Saturation)
The adaptive response to loading saturates quickly.
> Only a small number of loading cycles are needed to trigger a maximal adaptive response. Further loading beyond this point provides diminishing returns for bone formation on that day. Studies suggest as few as 40-100 cycles per day can be sufficient.

This implies that short, intense bouts of exercise are more efficient for stimulating bone than prolonged, continuous sessions.

## Rule 3: Cell Accommodation and Rest
Bone cells accommodate to familiar loading patterns, becoming less responsive over time.
> For a loading stimulus to remain effective, it must be novel or unusual, exceeding the loads the bone has become accustomed to.

Furthermore, inserting **rest periods** between loading bouts significantly enhances the bone formation response. Splitting an exercise session into multiple short bouts with several hours of rest in between is more effective than doing all the loading at once.
