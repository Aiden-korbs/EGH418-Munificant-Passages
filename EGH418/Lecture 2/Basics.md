# Basics

Space: geometric region occupied by bodies.
Position in space: relative to a geometric reference system via linear and angular measurements.
Primary inertial system: imaginary rectangular axes with no translation or rotation; basis of Newtonian mechanics.

Time: succession of events, absolute in Newtonian mechanics.
Mass: quantitative measure of inertia.
Force: vector action of one body on another.
Particle: negligible dimensions, valid when size is irrelevant.
Rigid body: negligible shape change compared to dimensions.

## Dimensions & Units
Dimensional homogeneity: all equations must be consistent.

Base quantities: L (length), M (mass), T (time).
Force is derived:
$$[F] = M\,L\,T^{-2}$$

## Newton’s Laws
1) A particle remains at rest or moves uniformly if $\sum F = 0$.
2) $$\vec{F} = m\,\vec{a}$$
3) Action–reaction: equal magnitude, opposite direction, collinear.

## Gravitation
$$F = G\,\frac{m_1 m_2}{R^2}$$
with $G = 6.673\times10^{-11}\ \text{m}^3\,\text{kg}^{-1}\,\text{s}^{-2}$ and $g \approx 9.81\ \text{m/s}^2$ at sea level.
