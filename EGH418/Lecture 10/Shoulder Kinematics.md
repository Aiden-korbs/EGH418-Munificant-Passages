Shoulder movement is a coordinated effort involving motion at all four of its joints. This complex interplay is necessary to achieve the arm's full range of motion.

## Range of Motion (ROM)
The total range of motion of the arm is a combination of movement at the glenohumeral joint (GHJ) and the scapulothoracic joint (STJ).

- **Flexion**: 180° total (approx. 110° from GHJ, 70° from STJ).
- **Abduction**: 180° total (approx. 120° from GHJ, 60° from STJ).
- **External/Internal Rotation**: Around 90° in each direction, primarily from the GHJ.

## Scapulohumeral Rhythm
During arm elevation (flexion or abduction), the humerus and scapula move in a coordinated pattern known as the **scapulohumeral rhythm**.

> For every 3° of total arm elevation, approximately 2° occurs at the glenohumeral joint, and 1° occurs at the scapulothoracic joint. This is often simplified as a **2:1 ratio**.

This coordinated rhythm is crucial for several reasons:
- It maintains the glenoid in an optimal position to receive the humeral head.
- It preserves the proper length-tension relationship for the deltoid and rotator cuff muscles.
- It helps prevent impingement of the rotator cuff tendons under the acromion.

## Describing Shoulder Motion
To accurately describe the complex 3D movements of the shoulder, biomechanists use standardised coordinate systems for each bone (thorax, clavicle, scapula, humerus).

- **Standardisation**: The International Society of Biomechanics (ISB) provides recommendations for defining these coordinate systems based on palpable bony landmarks.
- **Euler/Cardan Angles**: Joint motion is then described as a specific sequence of rotations (e.g., a Y-X-Y sequence) of the distal segment relative to the proximal one. This allows complex movements to be broken down into clinically understandable terms like "plane of elevation" and "axial rotation".
