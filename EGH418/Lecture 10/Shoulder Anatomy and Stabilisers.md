The shoulder is a highly mobile joint complex, composed of three bones, four joints, and more than 18 muscles. This intricate structure gives the shoulder the widest range of motion of any joint in the body.

## Bones and Joints
The shoulder complex is made up of four distinct joints that work together:
- **Glenohumeral Joint (GHJ)**: The main ball-and-socket joint. It's formed by the large, round humeral head articulating with the very shallow glenoid fossa of the scapula. This joint is often compared to a golf ball on a tee, highlighting its inherent lack of bony stability.
- **Acromioclavicular Joint (ACJ)**: Connects the acromion of the scapula to the clavicle.
- **Sternoclavicular Joint (SCJ)**: The only direct bony connection between the arm and the chest (axial skeleton).
- **Scapulothoracic Joint**: A "floating" joint where the scapula glides over the back of the ribcage, guided by muscles.

## Shoulder Stabilisers
Because of the glenohumeral joint's shallow socket, stability is primarily provided by soft tissues, which can be categorised as dynamic or static stabilisers.

### Dynamic Stabilisers (Muscles)
- **Rotator Cuff Muscles**: A group of four muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) that originate on the scapula and insert on the humeral head.
  > **Function**: The rotator cuff acts as a **humeral head depressor**. It creates a "force couple" that compresses the humeral head into the glenoid socket, counteracting the upward pull of the powerful deltoid muscle during arm elevation.
- **Scapular Muscles**: Muscles like the serratus anterior, trapezius, and rhomboids, which control the position and movement of the scapula. A stable scapula provides a solid base for glenohumeral joint function.

### Static Stabilisers (Ligaments and Structures)
- **Glenoid Labrum**: A fibrocartilage rim that deepens the glenoid socket, increasing its surface area and stability.
- **Glenohumeral Ligaments**: Thickenings of the joint capsule that act like a hammock, providing passive stability at the ends of the range of motion.
- **Negative Intra-articular Pressure**: A suction effect within the joint that helps hold the humeral head in the socket.
