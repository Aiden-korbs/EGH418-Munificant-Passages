The shoulder's reliance on soft tissues for stability makes it prone to a range of common pathologies.

## Rotator Cuff Disease
Rotator cuff tears are a frequent cause of shoulder pain and dysfunction.
- **Types**:
  - **Acute Traumatic**: Rare, usually from a high-energy impact.
  - **Degenerative**: The vast majority of cases, resulting from age-related wear and tear. By age 70, about 50% of people have a full-thickness tear.
- **Consequence**: A torn rotator cuff can no longer effectively depress the humeral head. The unopposed pull of the deltoid muscle causes the humeral head to migrate superiorly, leading to abrasion, further damage, and eventually **cuff tear arthropathy**.
- **Treatment**:
  - **Conservative**: Physiotherapy and cortisone injections.
  - **Surgical**: Arthroscopic repair, where the torn tendon is reattached to the bone using suture anchors. For massive, irreparable tears, a **superior capsular reconstruction** using an allograft may be performed to restore the head-depressing function.

## Glenohumeral Osteoarthritis
This is the wearing away of the articular cartilage in the glenohumeral joint, leading to pain and restricted motion.
- **Causes**: Can be primary (age-related), post-traumatic, or secondary to other conditions like cuff tear arthropathy.
- **Treatment**:
  - **Anatomic Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (TSA)**: The humeral head and glenoid socket are replaced with prosthetic components that mimic the natural anatomy. This requires a functioning rotator cuff to provide stability and power.
  - **Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty (rTSA)**: The ball-and-socket configuration is reversedâ€”a ball is placed on the glenoid and a socket on the humerus. This is used when the rotator cuff is deficient. The reverse design medialises the joint's centre of rotation, increasing the lever arm of the deltoid muscle, allowing it to elevate the arm without a functioning rotator cuff.

## Shoulder Instability
Instability occurs when the humeral head is unable to remain centred in the glenoid.
- **Mechanism**: A traumatic dislocation can damage the static stabilisers. This often involves a **Bankart lesion** (a tear of the anterior-inferior labrum) and a **Hill-Sachs defect** (a compression fracture on the back of the humeral head).
- **Treatment**: For significant bone loss on the glenoid, a **Latarjet procedure** is often performed. This involves transferring the coracoid process with its attached tendons to the front of the glenoid. This procedure provides stability through three mechanisms: restoring the bony arch, repairing the capsule, and creating a dynamic "sling effect" from the transferred tendons.
