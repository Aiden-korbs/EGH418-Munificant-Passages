The way a bone breaks provides clues about the type of loading it experienced. Different loading modes produce characteristic fracture patterns.

## Tension Loading
- **Mechanism**: Forces pulling the bone apart, often from a muscle or ligament avulsion.
- **Fracture Pattern**: Typically a **transverse** fracture. Occurs most often in bones with a high proportion of cancellous tissue, like the calcaneus or olecranon.

## Compression Loading
- **Mechanism**: Forces pushing the bone together.
- **Fracture Pattern**: Often results in **crushing** or **impaction** fractures. Common in vertebrae, especially in individuals with osteoporosis, where it can lead to a wedge deformity.

## Bending Loading
- **Mechanism**: A combination of tension on one side of the bone and compression on the other. A common cause of long bone fractures.
- **Fracture Pattern**: A **transverse** fracture that often starts on the tension side of the bone. A "butterfly" fragment can occur if the bone also fails in compression. The "boot-top" fracture in skiers is a classic example.

## Torsion Loading
- **Mechanism**: A twisting force applied along the bone's long axis.
- **Fracture Pattern**: A characteristic **spiral** fracture that runs up the shaft of the bone.

## Shear Loading
- **Mechanism**: Forces acting parallel to the bone surface.
- **Fracture Pattern**: A transverse fracture. This is less common in long bones and is usually associated with high-energy trauma.
