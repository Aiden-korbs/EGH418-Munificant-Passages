## Functions of Bone
Bone serves several critical functions in the body:
- **Mechanical**: Provides structural support for the body, creates a lever system for movement via muscle attachments, and protects internal organs.
- **Metabolic**: Acts as a reservoir for essential minerals, particularly calcium.
- **Protective**: Houses hematopoietic tissue (bone marrow) where blood cells are produced.

## Bone Classification and Structure
Bone is not a uniform material. It is classified by both shape and structure.
- **Shapes**: Long (femur), short (talus), flat (sternum), and irregular (vertebra).
- **Structure**: All bones are composed of two main types of tissue:
  - **Cortical (Compact) Bone**: The dense, solid outer shell of bones. It has low porosity.
  - **Cancellous (Spongy/Trabecular) Bone**: A porous, honeycomb-like network of struts and plates found at the ends of long bones and within vertebrae.

## The Hierarchical Structure of Bone
Bone's exceptional mechanical properties arise from its complex, hierarchical structure, which spans multiple length scales from the nano to the macro.
> **Level 1 (Nano)**: The basic building blocks are **tropocollagen** molecules and plate-like **hydroxyapatite** mineral crystals. These combine to form mineralized collagen fibrils.
> **Level 2 (Micro)**: Fibrils are arranged into sheets called **lamellae**. In cortical bone, these lamellae are organized into concentric cylinders called **osteons** (Haversian systems), which surround a central vascular channel.
> **Level 3 (Meso)**: At a larger scale, the osteons and interstitial bone, along with various levels of porosity (canaliculi, Haversian canals, resorption cavities), form the bulk of cortical bone tissue.

## Key Material Characteristics
To accurately model bone, we must consider its key characteristics:
- **Nonhomogeneous**: It is a composite material made of cells, organic phases (collagen), and inorganic phases (mineral).
- **Anisotropic**: Its mechanical properties are direction-dependent. Bone is strongest and stiffest in the direction it is typically loaded.
- **Viscoelastic**: Its response to load depends on the rate at which the load is applied. It is stiffer and stronger under rapid loading.
