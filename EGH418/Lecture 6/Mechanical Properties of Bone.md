The mechanical behaviour of bone is typically characterised by its stress-strain curve, obtained from [[Experimental Methods in Bone Mechanics]].

## The Stress-Strain Curve
The curve reveals several key material properties:
- **Young's Modulus ($E$)**: The slope of the initial linear-elastic region. It represents the material's stiffness. It is a measure of the material's resistance to elastic deformation.
- **Yield Strength ($\sigma_y$)**: The stress at which the material begins to deform plastically (permanently).
- **Ultimate Strength ($\sigma_{ult}$)**: The maximum stress the material can withstand before it begins to fail.
- **Fracture Strength ($\sigma_{fr}$)**: The stress at which the material completely breaks.
- **Toughness**: The total energy a material can absorb before fracturing, represented by the area under the stress-strain curve.

## Factors Influencing Bone Properties

### Anisotropy (Direction)
Bone is **anisotropic**, meaning its properties depend on the direction of loading.
> Cortical bone is significantly stronger and stiffer when loaded along its longitudinal axis (the primary loading direction) compared to when it's loaded in the transverse (radial or circumferential) directions.

### Apparent Density
The mechanical properties of bone, particularly trabecular bone, are strongly dependent on its **apparent density** ($\rho_{app}$), which is the mass of the bone tissue divided by the total bulk volume (including pores).
> A higher apparent density results in a significantly stiffer and stronger bone. Cortical bone is much stiffer and stronger than cancellous bone primarily because of its higher apparent density.

### Strain Rate (Viscoelasticity)
Bone is **viscoelastic**, so its properties change with the rate of loading.
> Bone becomes stiffer and stronger as the strain rate increases. This means it can withstand higher loads from rapid impacts (like running or jumping) than from slow, steady loads.

### Hydration
The mechanical properties of bone tested *in vitro* are highly dependent on whether it is wet or dry.
- **Wet Bone**: Physiologically relevant; more ductile and tough.
- **Dry Bone**: Stiffer and more brittle, with lower strength and toughness.
