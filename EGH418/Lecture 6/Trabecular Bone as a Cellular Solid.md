Trabecular (or cancellous) bone can be mechanically described as a **cellular solid**, similar to an open-cell foam. Its structure consists of an interconnected network of rods (trabeculae) and plates.

## Mechanical Behavior
When compressed, trabecular bone exhibits a characteristic stress-strain curve with three distinct regions:
1.  **Linear Elasticity**: At small strains, the trabeculae bend and compress elastically. The slope of this region gives the apparent Young's modulus ($E^*$).
2.  **Plastic Collapse**: As the load increases, the cells begin to collapse. This occurs at a nearly constant stress, known as the plateau stress. The collapse mechanism can be elastic buckling, plastic yielding, or brittle crushing of the trabeculae.
3.  **Densification**: After significant collapse, the opposing trabeculae begin to touch, and the structure rapidly stiffens as the material is compressed against itself.

## Dependence on Relative Density
The mechanical properties of trabecular bone are extremely sensitive to its **relative density** ($\rho^*/\rho_s$), which is the ratio of its apparent density to the density of the solid bone material itself.

Simple mechanical models based on the bending of the cell struts (trabeculae) can be used to derive scaling laws that relate the apparent properties to the relative density.
> For an open-cell foam where deformation is dominated by bending, the apparent modulus and strength scale with the relative density:
> - **Apparent Modulus**: $E^* \propto (\frac{\rho^*}{\rho_s})^2$
> - **Apparent Strength**: $\sigma^* \propto (\frac{\rho^*}{\rho_s})^{3/2}$

These relationships show that even a small decrease in bone density (as seen in osteoporosis) can lead to a dramatic reduction in the stiffness and strength of trabecular bone.
