## Bone Mineralization
Bone matrix stiffness and strength are closely linked to its **degree of mineralization**. Mineralization is the process by which calcium and phosphate ions form hydroxyapatite crystals within the organic collagen matrix.

This process occurs in two main phases:
1.  **Primary Mineralization**: A rapid phase that occurs over a few days, where about 70% of the final mineral content is deposited.
2.  **Secondary Mineralization**: A much slower phase that can last for months or years, where mineral crystals continue to grow and mature, and the mineral content slowly approaches its maximum value.

> A higher degree of bone mineralization (DMB) is strongly correlated with a higher tissue elastic modulus.

## The Bone Remodeling Cycle
Mineralization is a direct outcome of the continuous process of **bone remodeling**, which repairs micro-damage and adapts the skeleton to mechanical demands.

> Bone remodeling occurs in discrete packets of cellular activity, carried out by a **Basic Multicellular Unit (BMU)**.

The remodeling cycle follows a specific sequence:
1.  **Activation**: Precursor cells are recruited to the bone surface to become osteoclasts.
2.  **Resorption**: **Osteoclasts** excavate a small cavity in the bone, removing old or damaged tissue.
3.  **Reversal**: Osteoclasts disappear, and the surface is prepared for new bone formation.
4.  **Formation**: **Osteoblasts** are recruited to the cavity and begin to deposit a new organic matrix called osteoid.
5.  **Mineralization**: The newly formed osteoid begins to mineralise, first through the primary phase and then the slower secondary phase.

Diseases or treatments that alter the rate of bone remodeling can change the overall age and mineralization distribution of bone tissue, thereby affecting its bulk mechanical properties.
