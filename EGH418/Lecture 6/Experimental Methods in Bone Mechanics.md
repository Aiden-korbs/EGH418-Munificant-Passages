Determining the mechanical properties of bone is a multiscale challenge. Different experimental techniques are used to probe bone's behavior at different hierarchical levels.

## Organ Level (Whole Bone)
- **Method**: Three-point or four-point bending tests on an entire bone.
- **Measures**: **Structural properties** like whole-bone stiffness ($N/mm$) and strength ($N$). These results are influenced by both the material properties and the bone's geometry ([[Moments of Area]]).

## Tissue Level (Machined Samples)
- **Method**: Uniaxial tension or compression tests on standardized specimens (e.g., "dog-bone" shape) machined from cortical or trabecular bone.
- **Measures**: **Material properties** like Young's modulus ($E$) and ultimate strength ($\sigma_{ult}$), which are independent of sample geometry.

## Microstructural Level
- **Microindentation**: A small, hard tip is pressed into the bone surface. By measuring the force vs. penetration depth, local properties like hardness and modulus can be estimated *in situ* or even *in vivo*.
- **Micropillar Compression**: Micro-scale pillars of bone tissue are fabricated and then compressed to obtain stress-strain curves for a very small volume of material. This allows for testing specific microstructural features, like interstitial vs. osteonal bone.

## Nanostructural Level
- **Nanoindentation**: Similar to microindentation but operates at a much smaller scale (nanometers). It uses a very sharp indenter tip to probe the properties of individual lamellae or even clusters of mineralized collagen fibrils. The resulting load-displacement curve is used to calculate hardness and reduced modulus.

## Ultrasound
- **Method**: Measures the speed of sound waves traveling through a bone specimen.
- **Measures**: The velocities of different wave types (longitudinal, shear) in various directions can be used to calculate all 21 components of the [[Anisotropy and Elasticity Tensors|anisotropic stiffness tensor]] ($C_{ijkl}$) non-destructively.
