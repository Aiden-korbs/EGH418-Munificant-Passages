The hip joint is a ball-and-socket synovial joint, designed for stability and a wide range of motion. Understanding its anatomy is crucial for analysing its biomechanics.

## Key Bony Structures
- **Acetabulum**: The concave socket of the pelvis that the femoral head articulates with. It is lined with articular cartilage and deepened by a fibrocartilage rim called the **acetabular labrum**.
- **Femoral Head**: The convex, spherical proximal end of the femur. It's almost entirely covered in articular cartilage, except for a small pit (the fovea capitis) for the ligamentum teres.
- **Femoral Neck**: The structure connecting the femoral head to the femoral shaft. Its orientation is critical for joint function and biomechanics.

## Important Anatomical Angles
The geometry of the hip joint varies between individuals and has a significant impact on joint loading and muscle function.

### Angles of the Acetabulum
- **Centre-Edge Angle**: Viewed in the frontal plane, this measures the extent to which the acetabulum covers the top of the femoral head. A normal value is around 35°.
- **Acetabular Anteversion Angle**: Viewed in the transverse plane, this describes how much the acetabulum faces forward. The average value is about 20°.

### Angles of the Femur
- **Neck-Shaft Angle (NSA)**: Also called the angle of inclination. It is the angle between the femoral neck and the femoral shaft in the frontal plane.
  - **Normal**: Around 125° in adults.
  - **Coxa Vara**: An NSA significantly less than 125°. This increases the moment arm of the abductor muscles but also increases shear stress across the femoral neck.
  - **Coxa Valga**: An NSA significantly greater than 125°. This decreases the abductor moment arm but reduces shear stress.
- **Femoral Neck Angle (FNA)**: Also called the torsion or anteversion angle. It is the angle of the femoral neck in the transverse plane relative to the femoral condyles.
  - **Normal**: About 10°-20° of anteversion (forward twist) in adults.
  - **Excessive Anteversion**: An increased angle, which can cause an "in-toeing" gait pattern.
  - **Retroversion**: A decreased angle (or backward twist), which can cause an "out-toeing" gait.
