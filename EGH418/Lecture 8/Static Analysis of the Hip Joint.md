We can estimate the forces acting on the hip using a simplified 2D static equilibrium model. The classic example is analysing the forces during the single-leg stance phase of slow walking.

> In this phase, one foot is on the ground, and the body's weight must be balanced by the abductor muscles on the stance side. "Slow" walking implies we can neglect inertial forces.

## Free-Body Diagram and Forces
The model involves three main forces:
- **Body Weight (W)**: The gravitational force acting downwards through the body's centre of mass. For single-leg stance, this is typically taken as 80% of total body weight, as the weight of the stance leg itself is supported by the ground.
- **Abductor Muscle Force (F)**: The force generated by the hip abductor muscles (gluteus medius and minimus) to prevent the pelvis from dropping on the unsupported side.
- **Hip Joint Reaction Force (H)**: The force exerted by the acetabulum onto the femoral head. This is the "bone-on-bone" force we want to calculate.

## Equilibrium Calculations
We use the principles of static equilibrium to solve for the unknown forces.

### 1. Sum of Moments
To find the abductor muscle force ($F_y$), we take the sum of moments about the centre of the hip joint and set it to zero ($\Sigma M = 0$).
> The abductor muscles have a short moment arm ($L_1$), while the body weight has a much longer moment arm ($D$). A common simplification is $D = 2 \cdot L_1$.
> $$ \Sigma M_{hip} = (F_y \cdot L_1) - (W_y \cdot D) = 0 $$
> $$ F_y = \frac{W_y \cdot D}{L_1} = \frac{W_y \cdot (2 \cdot L_1)}{L_1} = 2 \cdot W_y $$
The abductor muscles must generate a force equal to twice the effective body weight to keep the pelvis level.

### 2. Sum of Forces
To find the hip joint reaction force ($H_y$), we sum the vertical forces and set it to zero ($\Sigma F_y = 0$).
> $$ \Sigma F_y = H_y - F_y - W_y = 0 $$
> $$ H_y = F_y + W_y = (2 \cdot W_y) + W_y = 3 \cdot W_y $$
Since $W_y$ is 80% of total body weight (0.8 BW), the final hip joint reaction force is:
> $$ H_y = 3 \cdot (0.8 \cdot \text{BW}) = 2.4 \cdot \text{BW} $$

This simple model shows that even when just standing on one leg, the hip joint experiences a force that is **more than double your body weight**.
