The high forces experienced by the hip joint can be managed or reduced through gait modifications, walking aids, or surgical intervention. These strategies all work by manipulating the static equilibrium equation.

> The core principle is to reduce the moment created by the body's weight, which in turn reduces the amount of abductor muscle force needed for balance, and consequently lowers the hip joint reaction force.

## Gait Modification (Duchenne Limp)
A person with weak abductor muscles or a painful hip may adopt a **Duchenne limp**.
- **Mechanism**: The person laterally leans their upper body over the stance leg.
- **Biomechanical Effect**: This shifts the body's centre of mass closer to the hip joint, **reducing the moment arm (D)** of the body weight. A smaller moment from body weight requires less opposing moment from the abductor muscles, thus reducing the joint reaction force.

## Use of a Cane
Using a cane is a highly effective way to reduce hip joint loading.
- **Mechanism**: The cane should be used in the hand **contralateral (opposite)** to the affected hip. The downward force on the cane creates a supporting moment that helps counteract the moment from the body weight.
- **Biomechanical Effect**: Because the cane has a very large moment arm (E) relative to the hip, even a small force on the cane creates a large assistive moment. This drastically reduces the required abductor muscle force.

> A force of just 10% of body weight on a contralateral cane can reduce the hip joint reaction force by approximately 20%. Using a cane on the ipsilateral (same) side would actually increase the joint load.

## Surgical Intervention
Certain surgical procedures can alter the hip's bony anatomy to create a more favourable mechanical environment.
- **Mechanism**: A **varus osteotomy**, for example, changes the [[Hip Joint Anatomy|neck-shaft angle]] to move the greater trochanter further laterally.
- **Biomechanical Effect**: This **increases the moment arm (L)** of the abductor muscles. A larger moment arm allows the muscles to generate the required balancing moment with less force, thereby reducing the hip joint reaction force.
