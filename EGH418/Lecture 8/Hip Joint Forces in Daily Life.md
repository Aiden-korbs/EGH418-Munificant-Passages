While simple static models provide a good estimate, the actual forces on the hip during dynamic activities are often much higher and can be measured in two main ways: computational modelling and direct *in vivo* measurement.

## Effect of Inertia
During dynamic activities like landing from a jump, the body must be decelerated. This deceleration creates an **inertial force** that acts in addition to the gravitational force of body weight.

> The total force acting on the body is the sum of the gravitational and inertial forces ($W^* = W_y + F_{in}$). This momentarily increases the effective body weight, which dramatically increases the required muscle force and the resulting hip joint force.

The magnitude of this inertial force depends on how quickly the body is decelerated. Bending the knees to "soften" a landing increases the time over which deceleration occurs, reducing the peak force.

## Computational and Experimental Results
More complex musculoskeletal models using [[Inverse Dynamics in 3D]] and direct measurements from **instrumented hip implants** provide a detailed picture of hip loads during various activities.

### Gait
- Hip joint forces during walking typically show two peaks during the stance phase.
- The magnitude of these peaks increases significantly with walking speed, from around 3 times body weight (BW) for slow walking to over 7 times BW for fast walking.

### High-Impact Activities
- Activities like jogging can produce peak forces of over 5 times BW.
- Unexpected events like **stumbling** can generate the highest forces, reaching up to **8.7 times BW**, as muscles contract powerfully to regain balance.

### Other Daily Activities
- Ascending and descending stairs generates peak loads of up to 5.5 times BW.
- Simply standing up from a chair can load the hip to over 2 times BW.
- Lifting the leg while lying down can load the hip to 2.5 times BW, which is significantly more than standing on two legs (~0.7 BW).
