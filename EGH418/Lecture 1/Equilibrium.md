## Types of Equilibrium
- **Static equilibrium**: Body is at rest with no acceleration.
- **Dynamic equilibrium**: Body is moving at constant velocity.

## Equilibrium Conditions in 3D

**Forces:**

$$
\sum F_x = 0 \quad \sum F_y = 0 \quad \sum F_z = 0
$$

**Moments:**

$$
\sum M_x = 0 \quad \sum M_y = 0 \quad \sum M_z = 0
$$
