## Moment
2D:

$$
M = F \cdot d
$$

3D:

$$
\vec{M} = \vec{r} \times \vec{F}
$$

Magnitude of a 3D moment:

$$
M = \sqrt{M_x^2 + M_y^2 + M_z^2}
$$

## Couple
- A couple is two equal and opposite **non-collinear** forces.
- Produces **pure rotation** without translation.
- Common in muscle-joint systems.
